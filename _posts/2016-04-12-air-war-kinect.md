With a Kinect sensor in hand, it would be  a waste if I don't develop sth interesting. Thus, I developed a simple motion sensing game based on the skeloton data obtained from kinect. Also, it helpt myself to train my C++ programming. 

### Demo Presentation

Control the plane to up, down, left, right, give up and kill all(ultimate).
