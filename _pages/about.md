Zhen ZHAO (赵振) has been with the [OpenEarthLab](https://science.openxlab.org.cn/) at the [Shanghai AI Laboratory](), and the [New Power System Research Center](https://www.hrl.ac.cn/4.html) at the [Huairou Laboratory](https://www.hrl.ac.cn/), as a Researcher, since June 2024. Dr. ZHAO obtained his Ph.D. from the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, the [University of Sydney (USYD)](https://www.sydney.edu.au/), under the supervision of Prof. [Luping Zhou](https://sites.google.com/view/lupingzhou) and Prof. [Wanli Ouyang](https://wlouyang.github.io/) from the USYD and Prof. [Lei Wang](https://scholars.uow.edu.au/display/lei_wang) from the University of Wollongong. His research interests include exploring semi/self-supervised learning techniques for label-efficient perception and developing multimodal foundation models for reasoning & decision-making tasks. Most recently, he focuses on AI for science, especially grid state estimation, trustworthy energy operations, and visual reconstructions from brain activity.
